# Linear Regression Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive linear regression analysis on an E-commerce dataset. The project demonstrates how linear regression can be applied to model relationships between variables and predict outcomes.

**Key features of the project:**

Data Preprocessing: Applied data cleaning techniques to prepare the dataset for modeling.

Feature Selection: Analyzed the dataset to select relevant features that influence the target variable, ensuring an effective regression model.

Linear Regression Model Implementation: Used the scikit-learn library to build a linear regression model. The code includes steps for splitting the data into training and testing sets, fitting the model, and generating predictions.

Model Evaluation: Evaluated the modelâ€™s performance using key metrics like R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). 

Data Visualization: Visualized the regression line and residuals to understand model accuracy and error distribution.
